/*
You have been hired to write a program that will register runners
for the race and give them instructions on race day.

Hereâ€™s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age)
and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late.
Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

* Race number:
- Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
- All others receive a number below 1000.

* Start time:
Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
- Early adults run at 9:30 am.
- Late adults run at 11:00 am.

* Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
